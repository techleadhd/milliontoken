<h3>Million Concept</h3>
  Million is a cryptocurrency pre-mined to a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens pegged to a minimum of 1.00 $USDC per token (with no maximum value).

<BR>
As Million gains popularity and usage, the value may increase above the initial peg-value of 1.00 $USDC.  For example, if 1000 people each want 1000 Millions, the fair market value of Million is 1.00 $USDC each. If 2000 people each want 1000 Millions, the fair market value of Million rises to 2.00 $USDC, thereby increasing the market cap of Million to 2 million $USDC.  Over time, the price of Million may reach 10 million, 100 million, or even higher.<BR>

  <h3> Million Properties</h3>
Million has some unique properties.

* **1,000,000 Fixed Limited Supply** - Million has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens total. No more can ever be created (guaranteed by code). Million is deflationary by nature.  Million begins with a peg of 1.00 $USDC per token, and its value increases over time with scarcity.
* **1+ Million Valuation** - With one million tokens in circulation, Million is worth a **minimum** of 1,000,000 $USDC total market capitalization but can be worth much more.
* **Moonshot Upside**.  For holders of Million, there is unlimited upside.  Unlike traditional stablecoins (pegged to 1 Token = 1 $USDC), Million has a fixed supply and therefore has an unbound maximum.  As Million gains popularity and circulation, it could potentially reach higher values being worth as much as 10 million or 100 million theoretically. The moon is the limit.
* **Millionaire Approved** - Million is founded and backed by millionaire TechLead (with a million subscribers on YouTube). As Million gains popularity amongst more and more people, it gains usage and acceptance as a form of digital currency spreading exponentially through word of mouth. With popularity, the value of Million grows.
* **Store of Value + Transactional Currency**.  As a decentralized currency secured by millions of computers worldwide on the Ethereum blockchain, Million can be used as both a store of value and a means of transaction.  Million's unique limited supply makes it especially ideal as a store of value with unlimited upside.  Million can be transferred in fractional amounts (up to 18 decimals), allowing it to be used for microtransactions as well.
* **Ethereum Blockchain** - Million exists as an ERC-20 smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, decentralized and validated by millions of computers worldwide.
